# C_Code_Examples
These are some C-Code examples that I've worked on for the SparkFun hiring process

## Arduino_Encoder_SerialComms.ino
This is the barebones sketch for the arduino in the project I completed for Impressio. 
Includes code for supervising the position of the absolute encoder output and sending it via serial output to another device.
Includes code for handling incoming serial communications which also handles toggling switches for an electromagnet.

## Testing_H-bridgev4.ino
This is a sketch of the functionality required for handling the custom H-bridge in the Impressio project.
Includes code for toggling switches on the H-bridge in order to drive the motor on the Winch one way or the other.
Includes code for handling incoming serial communications from Raspberry Pi which tells when to set the motor on or off.


## PES-Assignment-1-main.zip
This is from an assignment which I did in a class called programming embedded systems.
Includes basic functions for converting between types in C.
